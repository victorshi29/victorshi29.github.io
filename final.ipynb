    "## Introduction\n",
    "It has been a decade since the Great Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami of 2011, in which so many people's lives perished and their homes destroyed. People are still recovering from that disaster. Earthquakes have caused extensive amounts of damage, deaths, and injuries all over the world. Analyzing earthquake data will help find patterns in earthquake occurrences, allowing people to identify which areas are at risk. It may also be used to influence building design decisions so that buildings can be built to be earthquake-resistant, minimizing damage and fatalities in the event of a earthquake. Earthquakes can also provide valuable insights into the movement of the earth's tectonic plates.\n",

    "### An Explanation of Magnitude Scales\n",
    "Most people have probably heard of the Richter scale, a scale used to measure earthquake magnitude. However, the Richter scale does not measure the magnitudes of very large earthquakes precisely and cannot be used to compare earthquakes around the world. Today, the preferred method of measuring earthquakes is the moment magnitude scale, Mw or Mww. This magnitude scale is applicable to a wide range of magnitudes and can be used globally. There are many other magnitude scales, each which measures something different. We're gonna say that the differences in magnitude scales in our data table aren't significant enough to do anything about it. Magnitude scales are logarithmic (base 10), meaning that the level of shaking increases by 10 times for each whole number you go up. \n",

    "## Data Collection\n",
    "I used data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) at https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/. Since search results were limited to 20,000 results, I decided to focus on earthquakes with larger magnitudes. I filtered out results by selecting events from across the world that occurred from 1900 onwards and had a minimum magnitude of 6.0. I selected the option to output results as a .csv file and then imported the data into a pandas DataFrame. This is what the first 5 rows of the dataset looks like."

    "### Observations\n",
    "The most frequent area of large earthquakes is around the Ring of Fire, which is a belt consisting of several tectonic plate boundaries. The Ring of Fire stretches from the tip of South America to Alaska, and from Alaska to the Philippines and from the Philippines through New Zealand to the Antarctic Plate. From comparing the plate boundaries map and earthquake locations, it appears that the type of plate boundary has a relationship with the frequency of earthquakes. The Ring of Fire consists of mostly convergent boundaries while being the location of most of the world's earthquakes. And even within the Ring of Fire, areas that aren't convegent plate boundaries, such the coast of California, have less large earthquakes.\n",
    "  \n",
    "I also noticed that there are some earthquakes that don't occur right at a plate boundary, but somewhat close to one. Examining the heatmap of 7.0+ earthquakes, there are multiple earthquakes in Western China, north of the plate boundary at the Himalayan mountains. Another example is the earthquakes that occured inland of South America, east of the coast where the plate boundary is and east of the Andes mountains. In both of these cases, the plate boundaries are near major mountain ranges. This leads me to hypothesize that the large amounts of stress on the tectonic plates, indicated by the mountain ranges, is enough to cause earthquakes farther away.\n",

    "Knowing how often earthquakes occur is important for warning against future earthquakes. To start, let's just plot the earthquake magnitudes against time to see if there's any patterns in the data. The frequency of earthquakes should be independent of time but let's see."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Earthquakes are very complicated and are essentially impossible to predict right now. It's simply not possible to predict earthquakes from the patterns of previous earthquakes, and there needs to be more data. Although we can't predict them yet, we can still gain a lot of insight into the nature of earthquakes with the help of data visualization techniques. There is an especially large number of earthquakes on convergent plate boundaries. The world is bound to get an 8.0+ magnitude earthquake about once every 11 years or so."
